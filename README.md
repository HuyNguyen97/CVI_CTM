# CVI for the CTM

This is an implementation of Conjugate-Computation Variational Inference [Khan and Lin, 2017]
applied to Correlated Topic Models [Blei and Lafferty, 2007].

A Detailed derivation of the variational algorithm and experiments on several corpora can be found in the [report](report.pdf).
